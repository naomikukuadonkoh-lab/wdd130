        <p>Hi there! My name is Naomi Kukua Sullivan. I usually go by Kukua. I am from Ghana.
            In Ghana, if you are named Kukua, you were likely born on a Wednesday. I enjoy eating spicy foods. I love
            my Ghanaian foods. When I am not eating, I am busy being a mom, trying to complete my assignments
            or just staying indoors. I am currently a student at BYUPathway taking university classes online, aiming
            to complete my first certificate early next year!</p>

        <h2>Ghana</h2>
        <img src="images/countryghana.jpg" alt="Ghana Picture">
        <p> Ghana is a vibrant and welcoming country on the west coast of Africa, full of life, color, and warmth. From
            the lively
            streets of Accra to the historic castles along the Cape Coast, every corner tells a story of tradition and
            pride. You
            can wander through bustling markets, relax on golden beaches, or taste delicious local favorites like jollof
            rice,
            grilled tilapia, fufu and spicy meat or fish soup, tuo zaafi and more. What truly makes Ghana special,
            though, is its people
            — friendly, open-hearted, and always ready to make you feel at home. With music in the air, smiles all
            around, and a strong sense of community,
            Ghana is a place that captures your heart and stays with you long after you leave.</p>
